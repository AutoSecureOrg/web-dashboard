## Introduction

AutoSecure is a dashboard designed to automate tedious penetration testing tasks, providing cybersecurity professionals with a quick and comprehensive solution for assessing security vulnerabilities.

## Features

*   **System Testing:** Integrates with Metasploit to automatically search for and attempt relevant exploits based on discovered services on a single target or IP Range. Allows uploading and running custom Python exploit scripts.
*   **Web Application Scanning:** Performs vulnerability scanning on web applications, checking for common flaws like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, and insecure HTML practices. Allows uploading custom payloads.
*   **WiFi Analysis:** Tools for scanning WiFi networks, analyzing security protocols (WPA/WPA2/WPA3), and potentially launching attacks (requires appropriate hardware and permissions). Includes UPnP and router admin credential checking.
*   **Mobile Application Scanning:** Scans mobile APKs (.apk) files and mobile application soource code for vulnerabilities.
*   **AI Insights:** Leverages a locally hosted LLaMA 3 AI model and pulls live threat data(CVE, Severity with color emoji, Score, CWE, description, reference link) from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to detect vulnerabilities, flag the most critical CVEs, and generate expert remediation steps—including patch suggestions, detection commands, and mitigation strategies—automatically, instant, offline, and in real time.
*   **Report Generation:** Creates detailed PDF reports summarizing the findings from network, web, wifi and mobile scans.
